# Server Hosting
We can host on any modern Cloud provider service. The most common ones we use are Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, and Microsoft Azure. The example below is for Google Cloud but applies to the similar services other cloud providers use.

## Google Cloud (example)

### Compute Engine (GCE)
- Ubuntu **24.04 LTS** servers: **staging** and **production**

### VPC Network
- Static IP addresses

### Cloud SQL (MySQL)
- **MySQL 8.0** instances: **staging** and **production**

### Cloud Storage
- **User Uploads** bucket
- **DB Backup** bucket
